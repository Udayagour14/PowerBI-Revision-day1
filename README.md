Introduction &amp; Setup the Power BI
Late in 2010, the initial concept for Power BI was created, and “Project Crescent” was published the following year. The platform’s moniker was modified to “Power BI” in 2013. (where “BI” stands for “Business Intelligence”). Initially, the Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View add-ins for Excel served as the foundation for the product. 

We use the superstore sample dataset for Data Analysis using Power BI, below is the screenshot of the data.

These first three principles interact with Power BI in the following ways:

Power BI Desktop: Data modeling, dashboard development, report creation, and data extraction are all possible with Power BI Desktop, a desktop program. Power BI Desktop is the desktop software for Windows.
Power-BI-Desktop
 

Power BI service: The Power BI service is an online SaaS (Software as a Service) solution.
Power BI mobile apps: Users can interact with Power BI dashboards and reports via Power BI’s mobile apps, which are available for Android, iOS, and Windows.
With the help of these three components: Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—you can create, distribute, and use business insights in the way that is most helpful for you and your job. Power BI Gateway, Power BI Embedded, and Power BI API are a few other parts that address particular requirements. In addition to those three, Power BI additionally includes the following two components:

Power BI Report Server: When businesses want to publish internal dashboards and analytics yet keep this data behind a corporate firewall, they can use the Power BI Report Server. Paginated reports can be made using the Power BI Report Builder and shared using the Power BI service.
Power BI Market Place: It is a platform where third parties can develop visualizations that customers can use for certain purposes and sporadically pay for.
